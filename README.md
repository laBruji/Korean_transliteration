# Korean Transliteration System

This repository contains a Python script (`korean_transliteration.py`) and a reference file (`eng_to_kor.txt`) for an English-to-Korean transliteration system. The system aims to convert English words into their corresponding Korean phonetic representations.

### Notes

- The script utilizes a Context-Free Grammar (CFG) and probabilistic modeling to generate potential Hangul representations for English words.
- The reference file (`eng_to_kor.txt`) provides a manual mapping for common English words to their corresponding Korean transliterations.
- Keep in mind that the transliteration accuracy may vary, especially for words with unusual pronunciations or non-standard transliteration patterns.
